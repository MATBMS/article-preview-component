## What I learned

This is my first project incorporating JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements through class toggling. This fundamental technique opens the door to creating interactive user interfaces and dynamic content.

Key takeaways:

- DOM manipulation using `classList` methods
- Event handling for user interactions
- Toggling visual states through CSS classes
